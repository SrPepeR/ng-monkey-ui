# Changelog

All notable changes to `ngx-gorilla-ui`. The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `0.x` while the API settles, and `1.0.0` once the navigation and layout components ([roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md) point 5, in Spanish) are done.

The history of `ngx-monkey-ui`, the previous library, up to the unreleased `0.3.2`, is in the [`CHANGELOG.md` of the `ngx-monkey-ui-legacy` tag](https://github.com/SrPepeR/ng-gorilla-ui/blob/ngx-monkey-ui-legacy/CHANGELOG.md) (in Spanish).

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First version of `ngx-gorilla-ui`: the workspace and its tooling (roadmap point 0) and the foundations with the button (point 1).

### Added

- Design tokens in `ngx-gorilla-ui/styles/tokens.css`, inside `@layer gorilla` so any app rule overrides them without `!important`:
  - Eight 12-step palettes with `light-dark()` (gray, cyan, violet, magenta, green, amber, red, blue). The brand solids keep the `ngx-monkey-ui` tones in both themes.
  - Color roles (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `neutral`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`) whose solid and subtle pairs pass WCAG AA in both themes, plus surfaces, text, borders, focus ring, and selection.
  - Spacing, radius, shadow, typography, control height, and motion scales.
  - Reduced motion (durations to `0s`), more contrast, and forced colors support.
- `ngx-gorilla-ui/theme`: `GorillaTheme` (`theme`, `resolvedTheme`, `setTheme()`) and `provideGorillaTheme()`. Light, dark, and system themes; the choice is stored in `localStorage`, `system` follows `prefers-color-scheme` changes, and nothing is read or stored on the server.

### Project

- Angular 22 workspace with the `ngx-gorilla-ui` library (primary entry point exporting `GORILLA_VERSION`) and the zoneless `ngx-gorilla-ui-catalog` documentation app. Requires Node 24.
- Tooling: unit tests with Vitest in browser mode (Playwright, Chromium), ESLint with `angular-eslint` (`gorilla` selector prefix, template accessibility rules, no `any`), and CI running lint, format, tests, and build on every pull request.
- Catalog pages for theming and tokens, with a light, dark, and system theme switcher.
- Supported browsers: the last two versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, desktop and mobile (`.browserslistrc`).
- Contribution rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: premises (verified accessibility, overridable tokens, no abrupt changes, performance), branch flow, releases, and definition of done.
- CI also runs on pushes to `release/**` branches.
